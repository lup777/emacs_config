;; C-M-f runs forwared-sexp, move forward over a balanced expr that can be a pair or a symbol
;; C-M-b runs backward-sexp, move backward over a balanced expression that can be a pair or a symbol.
;; C-M-k runs kill-sexp, kill balanced expression forward that can be a pair or a symbol.
;; C-M-<SPC> or C-M-@ runs mark-sexp, put mark after following expression that can be a pair or a symbol.
;; C-M-a runs beginning-of-defun, which moves point to beginning of a function.
;; C-M-e runs end-of-defun, which moves point to end of a function.
;; C-M-h runs mark-defun, which put a region around whole current or following function.
;; Using gtags: by default, M-. runs ggtags-find-tag-dwim when ggtags-mode is enabled. The command ggtags-find-tag-dwim jump to tag base on context:
;;If the tag at point is a definition, ggtags jumps to a reference. If there is more than one reference, it displays a list of references.
;;If the tag at point is a reference, ggtags jumps to tag definition.
;;If the tag at point is an include header, it jumps to that header.
;;You can jump back to original location where you invoked ggtags-find-tag-dwim by M-,, which runs pop-tag-mark (if you follow my key bindings).

;;You can also find arbitrary tag definition when invoking M-. on blank space. A prompt asks you for tag pattern, which is a regexp.

;;If ggtags gives you a list of candidates, you can use M-n to move to next candidate and M-p to move back previous candidate. Use M-g s to invoke Isearch on candidate buffer list.

;; If you want to list all the functions that the current function - the function that point is inside - calls, you can do that with helm-gtags-tags-in-this-function, which is bound to C-c g a in my setup.
